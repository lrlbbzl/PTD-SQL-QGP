In this question, we need to use tables ['singer', 'song'].\n\n<3> SQL Generation: The query requires the names of singers and the total sales of their songs, so we should select the 'Name' column in the 'singer' table and the sum of the 'Sales' column in the 'song' table.\n\n", "predict": "SELECT T1.Name, SUM(T2.Sales) FROM singer AS T1 JOIN song AS T2 ON T1.Singer_ID = T2.Singer_ID GROUP BY T1.Singer_ID"}, {"db_id": "singer", "gold": "SELECT T1.Name ,  sum(T2.Sales) FROM singer AS T1 JOIN song AS T2 ON T1.Singer_ID  =  T2.Singer_ID GROUP BY T1.Name", "question": "For each singer name, what is the total sales for their songs?", "foreign_keys": "Foreign_keys = [song.Singer_ID = singer.Singer_ID]\n", "tables": "Table singer, columns = [*,Singer_ID,Name,Birth_Year,Net_Worth_Millions,Citizenship]\nTable song, columns = [*,Song_ID,Title,Singer_ID,Sales,Highest_Position]\n", "types": {"singer.Singer_ID": "number", "singer.Name": "text", "singer.Birth_Year": "number", "singer.Net_Worth_Millions": "number", "singer.Citizenship": "text", "song.Song_ID": "number", "song.Title": "text", "song.Singer_ID": "number", "song.Sales": "number", "song.Highest_Position": "number"}, "reasoning": "<1> Operation: The query requires the total sales for each singer's songs, so we should apply the 'sum' operation to the 'Sales' column in the 'song' table. Since the unit to which the sales being calculated in the query belong is the singer, we should apply the 'group by' operation to the 'Singer_ID' column in the 'song' table.\n\n<2> Schema Linking: In this step, we identify the tables and columns that should be used based on the first step and the foreign key relationships. In this question, we only need to use table ['song'].\n\n<3> SQL Generation: The query requires the total sales for each singer's songs, so we should select the 'Singer_ID' column in the 'song' table and sum the 'Sales' column.\n\n", "predict": "SELECT Singer_ID, SUM(Sales) FROM song GROUP BY Singer_ID"}]
